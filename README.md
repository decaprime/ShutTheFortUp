# ðŸ”“ Shut The Fort Up

This mod adds two commands `.close-all` and `.open-all`. Optionally you can specify the type like `.close-all doors` or `.open-all windows`. This idea was [suggested by Paridli](https://ideas.vrisingmods.com/posts/32/a-single-button-to-instantly-close-all-doors-windows-in-your-castle) on our ideas website https://ideas.vrisingmods.com and I thought it was a great candidate for a simple mod.

## Installation
This mod requires [VampireCommandFramework](https://github.com/decaprime/VampireCommandFramework) and [Wetstone](https://github.com/molenzwiebel/Wetstone) to function. You can download release versions from https://v-rising.thunderstore.io.

Put all plugins in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.
